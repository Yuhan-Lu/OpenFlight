# CS225 Final Project
## tinghan2-yf9-yuhanlu2-yiruiz2

## Overview
This is the CS225 final project developed by Eric Zhou, Lucas Lu, Joe Ye, and Yucheng Feng.          Our project implemented BFS and DFS to traverse all the available airports. Besides, we adopted Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two airports. Finally, our project        included PageRank, which could display the frequencies of airlines to different airports. For example, a popular airport would have a higher frequency value than a small airport. 

## Installation
No installation needed.

## Test
We include our tests in "tests" file.
Please run "make test" to see the outcome.
```bash
make test
./test
```

## Usage
We include some of our fundamental functions in main.cpp for testing and
displaying results. Please run "make" to see the outcome.
```bash
make
./main
```
For more information about a specific function, please refer to the function documentations
in each file.

## Contribution
We are using graph files, PNG files, and make files from cs225 class. Thanks for cs225's contribution.
